Updated version for the outdated Destiny - The Traveler mod, see the original mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=847164184] here [/url]
This mod currently has added the Traveler, a mysterious paracausal entity with the ability to bend or alter reality to a potentially extreme degree, to the Stellaris galaxy. While also adding bits and bobs from the Destiny Universe to the Stellaris Galaxy 

Future plans mainly include optimizations, modernizing the mod's code, and adding additional things from both Destiny 2 and Destiny to Stellaris.

[b][h2] Note[/h2][/b]
This mod is currently in a beta version, and can include breaking save updates at any update without warning as I attempt to improve and expand the features of the mod and eliminate bugs.

[b][h2] Changes [/h2][/b]
The current version is simply a modernizing of the existing mod's code base, future features will be added soon.
