 traveler.2.name:0 "Extragalactic Event"
 traveler.2.desc:0 "Observatories across the Galaxy have reported that a strange event has occured in intergalactic space. Gravitational waves stronger than any previously observed event were detected approximately 40,000 light years outside the galaxy. Oddly, the gravitational waves were accompanied by a burst of an unknown type of energy, far different than anything predicted by the current model of physics. Even stranger, the gravitational waves and unknown energy were detected simultaneously across the entire galaxy seemingly traveling faster than light. Scientists have refered to the event as "paracausal" as the readings seem to have ocurred outside the laws of causality."
 traveler.2.a:0 "Interesting"
 
 traveler.6.name:0 "Mysterious Object"
 traveler.6.desc:0 "Civillian ships in the [trav_system.GetName] system have reported sightings of a mysterious spherical object. Initially believed to be a rogue planetoid, further investigations have determined that the object is too smooth and uniform to be natural. It appears to move under it's own will, and as such has been nicknamed The Traveler. Our scientists have linked the object to the extragalactic event which occured a year earlier as the Traveler radiates the same energy previously detected."
 traveler.6.a:0 "Interesting. Continue observing the object."
 traveler.6.b:0 "This object must be of a divine origin."
 traveler.6.c:0 "A marvel of some distant civilization!"
 
 traveler.7.name:0 "Rumors"
 traveler.7.desc.owned:0 "Rumors of a mysterious object travelling through [trav_system_owner.GetName] space have been spreading throughout our population. These rumors describe a white sphere the size of a planetoid apparently moving under it's own will. The [trav_system_owner.GetSpeciesName] have not made a statement about the veracity of these claims."
 traveler.7.desc.unowned:0 "Rumors of a mysterious object travelling through uncolonized space near the [trav_system.GetName] have been spreading throughout our population. These rumors describe a white sphere the size of a planetoid apparently moving under it's own will. Although we have been unable to verify these claims, other empire's have reported similiar rumors in their own population."
 traveler.7.a:0 "Continue looking into these rumors."
 traveler.7.b:0 "This could be the work of the gods."
 traveler.7.c:0 "This could change everything we know."

 traveler.8.name:0 "The Traveler"
 traveler.8.desc:0 "The object previously described only in rumors has entered our borders. Our scientists have detected no radio signals emminating from it. Now known as "The Traveler," the object is under constant observation by hundreds of scientists."
 traveler.8.a:0 "Continue observing the object."
 traveler.8.b:0 "Send our priests in place of scientists."
 traveler.8.c:0 "Dedicate our scientists to this project."

 traveler.9.name:0 "The Traveler"
 traveler.9.desc:0 "Upon arriving in [Root.GetStarName], [Root.GetName] initial scans revealed a signifigant anomaly. Closer inspection showed that this anomaly matches the description of the object described in recent rumors. [Root.GetName] immediately sent a report back to the Capital.\n\nThe report describes the sphere as appearing neither mechanical, nor organic in nature, while also apparently moving with intelligence. While no radio signals were detected, an unknown energy which matches that of a previously observed extragalactic event seems to radiate from the object. The environment of a planet the object was seen orbiting appeared to be undergoing terraformation. However, no apparent interaction was observed between the object and the planet. A footnote included in the report by [Root.GetLeaderName] requests that the object officialy be called "The Traveler.""

 traveler.12.name:0 "Golden Age"
 traveler.12.desc:0 "The [trav_system_owner.GetRulerTitle] of [trav_system_owner.GetName] has announced the beginning of a Golden Age within their empire. They claim The Traveler, which is currently orbiting their capital system's star, is granting them knowledge through some unseen method."
 traveler.12.a:0 "Interesting."
 
 traveler.13.name:0 "Traveler Uplifting"
 traveler.13.desc:0 "A previously primitive species has broadcast a message announcing their arrival to the galactic stage. Initially our scientists are baffled by how such a primitive society has become so technologically advanced in such a short time. However, the message a detailed recent history of their rise into space. The new empire claims that the Traveler, which has been spotted in their home system, granted them the knowledge needed to achieve space travel. This new information only deepens the mystery of The Traveler."
 traveler.13.a:0 "Incredible."
 
 traveler.15.name:0 "Traveler Returns"
 traveler.15.desc:0 "The Traveler has returned to our home system. After it's long absence, the mysterious sphere has come back, granting us another golden age."
 traveler.15.a:0 "Amazing!"

 traveler.400.name:0 "Golden Age - A New AI"
 traveler.400.desc:0 "With the knowledge granted to us by The Traveler, our computing specialists believe they can devise a new, highly advanced method for developing artificial intelligence. However, they require a hefty investment in order to develop such a powerful AI. If the government were to provide this investment, we would have more influence over how it is used. If we do not, the researchers are likely to look into private investors."
 traveler.400.a:0 "Invest in the research."
 traveler.400.b:0 "We can't afford this."
 
 traveler.401.name:0 "Warmind - Construction"
 traveler.401.desc:0 "The initial research into the new AI project - now named Warmind - and are ready to move forward with a prototype. The newly designed facility will allow the project to develop the new ambitious AI with it's specialized AI core."
 traveler.401.a:0 "Ok."
 
 traveler.402.name:0 "Warmind - Alpha Build"
 traveler.402.desc:0 "The Warmind scientists are celebrating! The Alpha build of the Warmind AI is a success. Even in these early stages, the Warmind is operating beyond any previous artificial intelligence. It showed exceptional performance during standard combat training simulations. However, in order to perform more extensive tests the supercomputer will require far more energy than it is currently using. The Warmind Project has requested a large sum of energy credits be directed to the the project in order to achieve this."
 traveler.402.a:0 "Allocate the energy from our stockpiles."
 traveler.402.b:0 "Allocate a portion of our generated power."
 
 traveler.403.name:0 "Warmind - Field Trials"
 traveler.403.desc:0 "An update on the Warmind Project: The Warmind has performed so exceptionally and consistently throughout its simulated tests that the project leads have requested that we begin field tests immediately. The Project has suggested putting it into use in our fleet, and giving it limited control in order to improve combat efficiency."
 traveler.403.a:0 "Put the Warmind to work!"
 traveler.403.b:0 "Perhaps it would be better suited to a scientific field."
 
 traveler.404.name:0 "Warmind - Upgrades"
 traveler.404.desc:0 "With the Warmind Project excelling at an almost unbelievable rate, the project leads have informed us that another upgrade is needed. A new, massive AI core will need to be built in order for the Warmind to reach its true potential. Although they have yet to design such a computer, they assure us that with the help of our top scientists they will be able to complete it in no time."
 traveler.404.a:0 "Inform the scientists of the research."
 
 traveler.405.name:0 "Warmind - Rollout"
 traveler.405.desc:0 "While the main Warmind team was busy with the new AI core, a seperate team has been optimizing the Alpha build and has completed what they call "a retail build." Obviously no such AI would ever be cheap enough to sell off the shelf, but this team has presented us their vision of a Warmind on every colony. By building Warmind facilities across an empire, they could assist not only in strategic rolls, but also in improving economic efficiency and research assistance."
 traveler.405.a:0 "We will put this to good use."
 
 traveler.406.name:0 "Warmind - Online"
 traveler.406.desc:0 "Finally the day has come when the Warmind Project has achieved it's goal of hyper-intelligent AI. Upon activation, this Warmind - officialy named Warmind Prime - will gain executive control of many functions in the [Root.Owner.GetName] such as combat. "
 traveler.406.a:0 "Congratulations."
 
 traveler.408.name:0 "Golden Age - Medical Miracle"
 traveler.408.desc:0 "The onset of the Golden Age has caused advancement in many fields, but perhaps the most welcomed advancements are those in the medical field. Injuries and diseases previously thought to be fatal are now able to be treated and cured in a matter of days. As a result, the life expectancy in [This.GetName] has increased signifigantly. Our people are rejoicing in the streets."
 
 traveler.500.name:0 "Gift of the Traveler"
 traveler.500.desc:0 "Our observations of the terraformed planet have revealed that nearly every property of the planet has changed. The mass, temperature, atmospheric makeup, and weather patterns now match closely to our species homeworld. Additionally, life on this planet seems to have grown considerably faster than any other observed planet. Plants grow faster and animals reproduce at a higher rate. The ground team reported that the planet seem far more peaceful than any other planet they've been to, and a higher productivity was reported across the board. The Traveler seems to have crafted this planet for us, but its purpose remains unknown./n/nData we have collected on the terraforming process could allow our scientists to develop new terraforming techniques, opening up expansion to worlds never considered before."
 traveler.500.a:0 "Begin researching this right away."
 
 traveler.502.name:0 "Light Snuffed Out"
 traveler.502.desc:0 "In the moments before the final strike, a bright, intense, blinding light shone out from the Traveler. The burst of light crossed the galaxy instantaneously like a explosion announcing the death of the enigmatic machine. Sensors across the galaxy picked up gravitational waves more intense than any detected before. In that moment all lifeforms knew: The Traveler was dead."
 traveler.502.a:0 "A momentous day indeed."
 
 traveler.503.name:0 "Husk of a God"
 traveler.503.desc:0 "The debris gathered from the Traveler is incomprehensibly complicated. While we were unable to determine the uses of the mechanical parts, the raw material could prove useful. Results from testing the material indicate that it is made of no known element. Even stranger, it responds to scanning as if it doesn't exist at all. However, it is incredibly durable and exhibits many unusual properties. By coating ship hulls with the material, the hull integrity, shield capability, heat resistance could all be increased beyond previous capacities."
 traveler.503.a:0 "Research the material for military applications."
 
 traveler.504.name:0 "Light Snuffed Out"
 traveler.504.desc:0 "In a single instant, every living being felt the overwhelming dread of what had just occured. A bright, blinding light shone out across the entire galaxy, visible from everywhere at once, defying the speed of light. Sensors all across the galaxy - and perhaps the entire universe - flared as gravitational waves, gamma rays, and Light blasted out from the explosion. Without even being told we all knew: The Traveler was dead."
 traveler.504.a:0 "We will never forget this day."
